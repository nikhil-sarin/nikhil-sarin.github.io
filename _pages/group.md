If you are interested in working with me, please get in touch!
The best way to do this is to send me an email with a brief description of your research background and interests, 
and how you think we could work together. 

## Past students 
* **Ellen Lindjo** (Masters, 2025) -> Industry 
* **Wendy Wallace** (Masters, 2023) -> Research internship at NASA Goddard -> PhD at Hamburg University 
* **Antoine Gilles-Lordet** (Masters, 2023) -> PhD at Stockholm University. 
* **Nico Keeghan** (Masters, 2021) -> Industry 
* **Teagan Clark** (Undergraduate research project, 2019) -> PhD at Monash University -> Postdoc at Princeton University.

Below is short list of research themes I am happy to supervise students on, 
but if you have a different idea, please feel free to get in touch!

## Research themes
* Modelling the lightcurves and spectra of EM transients.
* Modelling the neutron-star binary mergers.
* Inference on EM transient and GW observations using Bayesian/ML methods.
* Population synthesis modelling of the progenitors of BNS/NSBH mergers.
