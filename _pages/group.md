If you are interested in working with me, get in touch via email. 
I am always happy to supervise students at the undergraduate, masters or PhD level. 
The best way to ensure you get a response is sending me an email with a brief description of your research background and interests, 
and how you think we could work together.

## Past students 
* **Ellen Lindjo** (Masters, 2025) -> Industry 
* **Wendy Wallace** (Masters, 2023) -> Research internship at NASA Goddard -> PhD at Hamburg University 
* **Antoine Gilles-Lordet** (Masters, 2023) -> PhD at Stockholm University. 
* **Nico Keeghan** (Undergraduate research project, 2021) -> Industry 
* **Teagan Clark** (Undergraduate research project, 2019) -> PhD at Monash University -> Postdoc

Below is short list of research themes I am happy to supervise students on. 
If you have a different idea, feel free to get in touch!

## Research themes
* Modelling the lightcurves and spectra of EM transients.
* Modelling neutron-star binary merger progenitors and aftermath.
* Inference on EM transient and GW observations using Bayesian/ML methods.
* Population synthesis modelling of the progenitors of BNS/NSBH mergers, and neutron stars.
