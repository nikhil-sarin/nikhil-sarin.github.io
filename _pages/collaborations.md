## LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC)

**Role:** Full member and contributor

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration operates the Advanced LIGO gravitational-wave detectors and analyzes their data. I contribute to:
- Parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences
- Multi-messenger follow-up of gravitational-wave events
- Development of inference methods (Bilby)

**Key Contributions:**
- Co-author on major GW discovery papers
- Validation of parameter estimation pipelines
- Multi-messenger analysis combining GW and EM data

## Vera C. Rubin Observatory - LSST

**Role:** Member, Transients and Variable Stars Science Collaboration

The Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will conduct a 10-year survey of the southern sky, discovering millions of transients.

**Contributions:**
- Target-of-Opportunity observation planning
- Kilonova detection and follow-up strategies
- Transient classification and modeling

**Recent Work:**
- Andreoni et al. 2024 - _Rubin ToO 2024: Envisioning the Vera C. Rubin Observatory LSST Target of Opportunity program_

## Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)

**Role:** Active collaborator

ZTF is a time-domain survey discovering thousands of transients per night. I work on:
- Broad-lined Type Ic supernova classification
- GRB optical counterpart searches
- Strongly-lensed supernova candidates

**Recent Papers:**
- Srinivasaragavan et al. 2024 - _Optical and Radio Analysis of Systemically Classified Broad-lined Type Ic Supernovae_
- Das et al. 2025 - _Low-Luminosity Type IIP Supernovae from the ZTF Census of the Local Universe_

## Einstein Probe

**Role:** Collaborator on Fast X-ray Transient follow-up

The Einstein Probe is an X-ray satellite designed to discover fast X-ray transients. I contribute to:
- Theoretical modeling of FXT emission mechanisms
- Multi-wavelength follow-up coordination
- Physical interpretation of FXT properties

**Recent Einstein Probe Papers:**
- Rastinejad et al. 2025 - _EP 250108a/SN 2025kg observations_
- Srinivasaragavan et al. 2025 - _EP250108a: A Broad-Line Type Ic Supernova_
- Jiang et al. 2025 - _EP240801a/XRF 240801B: An X-ray Flash_
- van-dalen et al. 2024 - _The Einstein Probe transient EP240414a_
