I am a Kavli Senior Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge
and at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge.
Previously, I was a Nordita/OKC postdoctoral fellow at the Nordita Institute and the
Oskar Klein Center at Stockholm University.
My journey started at Monash University, where I completed my PhD in astrophysics in 2021.

I am a theoretical astrophysicist using a combination of analytical and numerical modelling combined with powerful
statistical techniques such as Bayesian inference, hierarchical modelling,
and machine learning to interpret observations.
I am particularly interested in the multi-messenger astrophysics of neutron star mergers,
the lightcurves of electromagnetic transients like GRBs, supernovae, TDEs, and kilonovae,
and neutron stars in general.

I am a member of numerous collaborations working on electromagnetic transients and gravitational waves,
including the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and
the Transients and Variables group in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
